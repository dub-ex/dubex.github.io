		<h2> Why are you a thing? </h2>
		<p>  We exist to foster an environment and community that shares an appreciation for diversity and unwavering global curiosity. We aim to support the world’s next global thinkers as they continue to inspire and change the world together. We believe that an international understanding comes through experience and exposure, and so by providing a platform to nurture and share our own experiences and perspectives, we hope to build human connections and knowledge bases that span cities, countries, and continents alike. </p>
		<br>
		<h2> That's awesome. What kind of people are you looking for? </h2>
		<p> International, urbanite, global nomad, mobile citizen, curious, expatriate. If you embody any or all of these qualities, we think that you’ll be a great addition to our community. We strive to continue to push the boundaries of cultural understanding and global perspective, and anyone that’s willing to contribute to that future is welcome in our book. </p>
		<br>
		<h2> How do I get involved? </h2>
		<p> Membership is open. As a <em>General Member</em>, you're invited to all our events; whether they be our student success panels, daytrips, Explore Seattle outings, or kickbacks alike. If you'd like to share your perspective even more, we'd love it if you became an <em>Ambassador</em>. </p>
		<br>
		<h2> I'm interested in doing more. What's an Ambassador? </h2>
		<p> <em> DubEx Ambassadors </em> are a set of members that are particularly passionate about our cause. DubEx exists to support you– our family, and so by putting you in a leadership role as we run our events and nurture our community, we can better tailor the experience to you. </p>
		<br>
		<h2> Is there a membership fee? </h2>
		<p> Nope. However, to keep our events running, we'd love it if you could support us with the occasional donation. </p>
